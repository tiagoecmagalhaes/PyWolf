?# Propagation of Light from the Sun to Earth

- The Sun is assumed as an incoherent and homogeneous source
- It's radius is approximately 6.96E8 meters
- The distance Sun-Earth is approximately 1.496e11 meters
- The far-field approximation is used

- We will use N=128 and, therefore, the CSDA will have N^4 complex elements. 

- We will not use zero padding for the FFT

- The angular frequency will be w0 =3.24992e15 rad/seg (yellow)

- The geometry will be a circle, with a radius (in arbitrary units) of r=7

- Therefore, the spatial resolution will be the radius of the Sun divided by the radius in arbitrary units, i.e., 6.96E8/7 = 9.943e7

- The coherence model is incoherent
