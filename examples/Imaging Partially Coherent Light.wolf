?# Aperture effects in an imaging system with partially coherent light

- Incoherent and homogeneous source with rectangular shape
- dimensions: 10 x 30 micrometers
- two progation planes: the 1st with an aperture and a thin lens and the 2nd is the observation plane 
- The distances and focal length of the lens must obey the lens equation
- The far-field approximation is used in both planes

- We will use N=200 (no zero padding)

- The angular frequency will be w0 =2.8560e15 rad/seg (red)

- The geometry model is a rectangule

- The coherence model is Incoherent
