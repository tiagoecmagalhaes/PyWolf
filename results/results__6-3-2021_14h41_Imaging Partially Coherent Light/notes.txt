# Aperture effects in an imaging system with partially coherent light

- Coherent and homogeneous source with squared shape
- the length of the square is 2 micrometers
- The distance is such that the spatial resolution in the propagation plane equals that of the source plane
- The far-field approximation is NOT used

- We will use N=200 with a zero padding of Nz=512

- The angular frequency will be w0 =3.1416e15 rad/seg (red)

- The geometry will be a sware, with a radius (in arbitrary units) of Na=57

- The coherence model is Coherent
