# Gaussian Schell-model beam

- Gaussian Schell-model
- The distance is such that the spatial resolution of the observation plane is the same as the source plane
- The far-field approximation is NOT used

- We will use N=200 WITHOUT a zero padding

- The angular frequency will be w0 =2.9920e15 rad/seg (630 nm)
