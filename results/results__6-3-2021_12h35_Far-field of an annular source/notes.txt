# Far-field propagation of an annular source

- Incoherent and homogeneous source with annular shape
- Inner radius is 5 mm and outter radius is 11 mm.
- The distance is 1 meter, where the far-field approximation is valid.
- The far-field approximation is used

- We will use N=200 with a zero padding of Nz=512

- We will use zero padding for the FFT

- The angular frequency will be w0 =3.7699e15 rad/seg (yellow)

- Annular geometry.

- The coherence model is Incoherent.
